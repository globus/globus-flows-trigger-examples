"""The function below is used by the tar-and-transfer flow.
In order to use it, you must first register it with the
Globus Compute service, as described here:
https://globus-compute.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sdk.html#registering-functions
(code is also provided below).

This function uses the tarfile module, which is part of the standard
Python library (it also assumes the gzip module is available). It accepts a
list of files/paths (as strings) and the name of the resulting archive file.
'inputs' is a list of absolute paths and 'output' is the absolute path to
the resulting archive file.
